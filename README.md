General Summary

The majority of the high-income countries have a low birth rate with a couple of outliers having both a high income and a high birth rate of 35. The outliers have high per capita income and birth rates because of low population levels relative to their GDP a common feature among resource-rich, low population countries with poorly developed economies, slower communication networks, characterized by low internet penetration levels. The particular country, in this case, is Gabon which happens to be resource-rich -oil- but with a poorly developed economy.
